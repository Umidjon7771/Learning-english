He was kind and always helped other animals.

One day, a hungry wolf saw the rabbit and wanted to catch him.

"Ah, little rabbit," said the wolf, "I will eat you for dinner!"

But the rabbit was very smart. He stayed calm and said:

"Dear Mr. Wolf, I am very small and thin. You won‚Äôt enjoy eating me.
But look! Under that tree, there‚Äôs a big fat chicken. Why don‚Äôt you eat that one instead?"

The wolf looked at the chicken, licked his lips, and ran after it.

The rabbit quickly ran away and hid in a safe place.

When the wolf came back, the rabbit was gone.
He looked around but found nothing. The clever rabbit had escaped!

From that day on, the wolf remembered how smart the rabbit was.
